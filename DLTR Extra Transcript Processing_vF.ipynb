       "[{'question': \"I wanted to start with just the tariff side and the mitigation. So it sounds like $20 million a month or about $0.85 a share is not in guidance. Can you talk about the potential mitigation of that? What are the efforts that you currently have on deck in order to see -- to mitigate that, your confidence level around your ability to offset it? And then as part of this, Mike, it does seem like you have new price points on deck, just from what we can see, $1.50, $1.75. I don't know if that's a test or not. But how important could that be to offsetting this as well? I'm just curious as to how you put all this together and you view your opportunity to mitigate what potentially could be ahead.\",\n",
       "  'answer': 'yes'},\n",
       " {'question': \"So Mike, I think the fact that Dollar Tree quantified the 90% mitigation of the first 10% from China and the fact that the second 10% from China is currently being collected, is being assumed by the market that, that's a cost that should be embedded in the P&L for this year. So a, is that wrong? And b, can you give us a sense of what your overall sourcing portfolio looks like right now, such that when the reciprocal tariffs do come out, if they do, we can get a sense for the exposures for the core Dollar Tree, and that would help us understand the potential financial impact? And then on top of that, to what extent is Dollar Tree willing to use its balance sheet and all the cash that has on its balance sheet, especially as the Family Dollar sales consummated to offset the potential margin implications of these tariffs and support the EPS outlook from here?\",\n",
       "  'answer': 'yes'},\n",
       " {'question': \"Congratulations on the Family Dollar sale. Mike, I wanted to ask you the, I guess, philosophy of how you're going to run the business over the next few years. You have a fresh start now with one asset. And if you look back, inflation has been pretty challenging for Dollar stores. And now you still have to navigate tariffs. So I wanted to ask how you think about margins for the business. Do you invest during the next several years, keeping margin down to reinvest back in the company? You have your competitors. Your biggest one is reinvesting in itself. Not sure what Family Dollar's plans will be. But curious, do you let margins run up? Or do you have to keep a lot of ammunition and firepower given the pretty uncertain backdrop that the Dollar stores have been navigating for the last several years?\",\n",

And maybe just drivers of 3% to 5% comps in the first quarter relative to the 2% comp that you did in the fourth quarter. Have you seen acceleration so far quarter-to-date? And is it traffic or ticket?\",\n",

When I think about discretionary, particularly around seasonal, right, because you did a lot of new stuff with holiday last year. So priority is there, priorities with regard to multi-price point cooler expansion. And then when you think about comp getting better by maybe 200 basis points, do you think it's equal between discretionary and consumable, each go up by an equal amount? Or is there a difference?\",\n",

Just wondering if you could just speak to that directional change for us. And then on the '25 outlook, on a 3% to 5% comp, you're expecting 50 to 80 basis points of deleverage. Can you just speak to the factors that are going against you? Do you think you get a little bit more leverage on such a great comp?\",\n",

And just as a follow-up to all the tariff questions, you mentioned that you can mitigate 90%, I think, of the first round of tariffs. Does that mean that the remaining 10% is going to be mitigated with higher prices?',\n",

And just how much are recent price moves a driver of AUR and ticket? And then just last, when is there a clean break from the TSA?

One is, what is the right run rate to think about for Dollar Tree banner on operating margin once we get past transition in 2025?

Can you talk about the potential mitigation of that? What are the efforts that you currently have on deck in order to see -- to mitigate that, your confidence level around your ability to offset it? And then as part of this, Mike, it does seem like you have new price points on deck, just from what we can see, $1.50, $1.75. I don't know if that's a test or not. But how important could that be to offsetting this as well? I'm just curious as to how you put all this together and you view your opportunity to mitigate what potentially could be ahead.\",\n",

So a, is that wrong? And b, can you give us a sense of what your overall sourcing portfolio looks like right now, such that when the reciprocal tariffs do come out, if they do, we can get a sense for the exposures for the core Dollar Tree, and that would help us understand the potential financial impact? And then on top of that, to what extent is Dollar Tree willing to use its balance sheet and all the cash that has on its balance sheet, especially as the Family Dollar sales consummated to offset the potential margin implications of these tariffs and support the EPS outlook from here?\",\n",

You have a fresh start now with one asset. And if you look back, inflation has been pretty challenging for Dollar stores. And now you still have to navigate tariffs. So I wanted to ask how you think about margins for the business. Do you invest during the next several years, keeping margin down to reinvest back in the company? You have your competitors. Your biggest one is reinvesting in itself. Not sure what Family Dollar's plans will be. But curious, do you let margins run up? Or do you have to keep a lot of ammunition and firepower given the pretty uncertain backdrop that the Dollar stores have been navigating for the last several years?\",\n",

    "Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons discussed today for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 are against the same period a year ago. Please note that a supplemental slide deck outlining selected operating metrics is available on the IR section of our website.\n",
    "Following our prepared remarks, Mike, Jeff and Stewart will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to now turn the call over to Mike.\n",
    "Michael C. CreedonDollar Tree, Inc. · CEO & Director\n",
    "Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Today is a very exciting day for our company. As I'm sure most of you saw this morning, we announced that Brigade-Macellum will acquire our Family Dollar business for a total price of just over $1 billion.\n",
    "After a thorough review of our strategic alternatives, the company determined that a sale of Family Dollar is the best way to achieve our value creation goals.\n",
    "Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are 2 different businesses with limited synergies, and each is at a very different stage of its journey. Separating them will enable each banner to be led and managed by a dedicated team that can focus exclusively on that banner's distinct needs and on realizing each banner's full potential.\n",
    "Separating will also enable investors to own a business they value more without also having to own a business they value less or that may not fit in their investment profile. It should also make it easier for the market to properly value each business.\n",
    "Under the terms of the deal, subject to certain closing adjustments, Dollar Tree will receive just over $800 million in cash proceeds. The deal should close in about 90 days, and Family Dollar will remain headquartered here in Chesapeake.\n",
    "In the fourth quarter, our team was focused on achieving 3 distinct objectives: successfully closing out the year; bringing the strategic review to a favorable conclusion; and setting Dollar Tree on a path to realize its full potential and create long-term value for our associates, customers and shareholders.\n",
    "With a strong finish to 2024 and the sale of Family Dollar set to close later this year, my leadership team and I will fully dedicate ourselves to Dollar Tree's long-term growth, profitability and returns on capital. Our focus and energy will be devoted to growing sales and profits at this iconic and powerful retail brand.\n",
    "Dollar Tree offers customers incredible value, convenience and discovery. Our world-class merchants consistently provide our shoppers with an unparalleled and ever-changing assortment of discretionary and consumable products. No other retailer or e-commerce platform can reproduce the immediacy and thrill of that signature Dollar Tree treasure hunt. This is our heritage, and this is our future.\n",
    "One of our founders, Macon Brock, always spoke of running clean, bright and inviting stores that exceed our customers' expectations. With Dollar Tree as our sole focus, we can remain true to that vision and return to our roots, while still competing and innovating in the marketplace in new and better ways than we could before.\n",
    "With value, convenience and discovery, Dollar Tree offers just what the customer needs in today's value-seeking environment. By delivering on the fundamentals, we can drive the sales productivity and profitability necessary to create long-term value for our associates, customers and shareholders.\n",
    "With that, let's now turn to our results. 2024 ended strong as Dollar Tree's multi-price journey continued to build momentum and improvements in store standards and operational efficiency are creating the foundation for sustainable growth and value creation. Fourth quarter results reflect the positive impact of our expanded assortment with our newest multi-price offerings, especially in holiday categories, driving strong year-end sell-through.\n",
    "In the current economic landscape, we continue to see value-seeking behavior across all customer groups. In recent weeks, many retailers reported that customers, particularly middle-income customers, are shifting towards alternatives that present value. Dollar Tree is also seeing middle-income shoppers who make up about half of our customer base, focusing more on value.\n",
    "At the same time, we are seeing stronger demand from higher-income customers who increasingly see Dollar Tree as a cost-effective source for an expanding range of products. This trade-in has helped to offset other headwinds.\n",
    "We believe our ability to continue gaining market share amid such challenging market conditions shows that consumers appreciate the discovery aspect of our unique assortment and our compelling value proposition.\n",
    "Dollar Tree's Q4 comp was 2%. The quarter got off to a slow start with the late Thanksgiving, but our merchandising teams delivered across the broader holiday season as customers responded positively to our expanded multi-price holiday assortment.\n",
    "We are particularly gratified that our comp growth was balanced with traffic up 0.7% and ticket up 1.3%. Not only were both positive measures, but ticket actually grew faster than traffic for the first time since Q4 of 2022, during the tail end of the anniversary impact from breaking the dollar.\n",
    "We are encouraged by the deceleration in consumables mix shift this quarter, which was supported by the strong performance of our expanded holiday assortment. Q4 consumables mix increased 60 basis points to 45.2%, which is an improvement over the average per quarter mix shift of roughly 200 basis points we've seen recently.\n",
    "Consumables comp was 4.2%, which was on top of a 10.8% comp last year. Discretionary comp was 0.4%, its first positive reading since Q4 of last year.\n",
    "Multi-price clearly provided a boost to our Q4 performance. And while we are still in the early stages of this journey, I'm pleased with the progress so far and excited about the opportunity still ahead.\n",
    "With that, let me share some highlights of how our expanded assortment boosted our Q4 results. First, as a reminder, our 3.0 stores are new or converted stores that offer our expanded multi-price assortment throughout the store. Other formats include 2.0, which have a smaller multi-price assortment that is concentrated in a single aisle we call the valley and our 1.0 stores, which are over 95% of the items are still at $1.25.\n",
    "So in Q4, our in-line 3.0 stores saw a 220 basis point comp lift compared to other formats, including a 40 basis point consumables lift and a 290 basis point discretionary lift. Compared to other formats, 3.0 stores also saw a 20 basis point traffic lift and, more importantly, a 200 basis point ticket lift.\n",
    "Our merchandising team worked tirelessly to improve and refine execution around our expanded assortment, especially in holiday categories. Across seasonal merchandise broadly, our 3.0 stores saw a 10 percentage point comp lift over other formats, including 30 points in Thanksgiving and 15 points in Christmas.\n",
    "In everyday categories like textiles, electronics, apparel and toys, we saw comp lifts in the low to mid-teens. Toys, in particular, was a big winner this season. And even in underperforming categories like books, beauty and food, that was more by design as we cut space allocations for these items to make way for more productive categories.\n",
    "We finished the year with approximately 2,900 3.0 format stores, including roughly 2,600 conversions and 300 new stores. While the number of 3.0 conversions this year fell a bit short of target, we continue to believe it is better to not rush and get them done right with the least amount of disruption for our customers and associates. To that end, we are targeting approximately 5,200 3.0 stores by the end of 2025, including 2,000 new conversions and 300 new stores.\n",
    "In summary, we're pleased with the first year performance of our expanded assortment in our 3.0 stores. The traffic, ticket and sales lift that we saw is validating the investments we're making in our expanded assortment.\n",
    "Before I wrap up the Q4 results, I should note that with the decision to sell Family Dollar, from an accounting perspective, our Dollar Tree and Corporate segments are now reported as continuing operations and Family Dollar results are reported as discontinued operations.\n",
    "Net sales from continuing operations increased 0.7% to $5 billion, reflecting the solid comp performance and strong revenue contribution from noncomp stores, including the former 99 Cents Only portfolio, offset by lapping the 53rd week of last year.\n",
    "Net sales from discontinued operations decreased 11.2% to $3.3 billion, reflecting Family Dollar's 1.3% comp, the impact of store closings and the lapping of last year's 53rd week. Therefore, on a consolidated basis, net sales were $8.3 billion, which was at the high end of our $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion outlook range.\n",
    "I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about tariffs and give you a quick supply chain update. As a large retailer and significant importer, we have years of experience dealing with global trade variability. As discussed last quarter, we have multiple contingencies in place to address a variety of tariff scenarios and mitigate the earnings impact of higher tariffs.\n",
    "These include negotiating supplier cost concessions, changing product specs, dropping noneconomical items, moving country of origin and, lastly, exercising the flexibility multi-price gives us. While we are focused on limiting the financial impact of any new tariffs, we are equally committed to continuously delivering value and market leadership on the items we offer our customers and differentiating ourselves from our competitors across the retail landscape.\n",
    "Our strategies to diversify country of origin sourcing have been in place for some time now. We intend to remain flexible and nimble, focusing our efforts on sourcing products via channels that deliver the lowest landed cost to us in order to maintain value continuity for our customers.\n",
    "This includes the optionality to shift sourcing to and from different countries within a relatively short time frame. For example, given our anticipated 2025 imports, the expected net impact of the 10% China tariff that was announced on February 4 prior to any mitigation efforts would have been about $15 million to $20 million per month. Based on our mitigation efforts to date, we have offset more than 90% of this incremental cost, which is reflected in our current 2025 outlook.\n",
    "With respect to the additional tariffs proposed in March, which included an additional 10% on goods from China and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico, we believe our potential pre-mitigation exposure is approximately $20 million per month.\n",
    "As we speak, our merchants are working to mitigate the impact of this latest round of tariffs. On top of that, we are evaluating the potential impact of any additional tariffs that could materialize and impact our sourcing efforts. We have not reflected the impact of this second round of tariffs in our 2025 outlook as the net impact will depend on the eventual policy and the degree, scope and timing of our mitigation efforts.\n",
    "The imposition of this year's tariffs has introduced uncertainty and volatility. But over the long term, we believe that our mitigation efforts can help us prevent sustained margin erosion.\n",
    "Finally, concerning our supply chain operations, we will be replacing the DC capacity we lost in Marietta, Oklahoma, and we'll communicate our plans to you once they are finalized. In the interim, we will continue incurring additional stem mile and other related costs until a replacement is up and running.\n",
    "As an immediate step to help ease some of our current network pressure and support our growing store base, prior to the closing of the sale, we plan to convert the Family Dollar distribution center in Odessa, Texas to a Dollar Tree distribution center.\n",
    "In sum, we finished 2024 on a high note with strong execution at Dollar Tree. Our results reflected sales momentum powered by growing consumer acceptance of our expanded assortment. With the pending sale of Family Dollar, I am excited at the opportunity to return to Dollar Tree's roots and begin to unlock the full potential of this iconic retail brand.\n",
    "Before I turn the call over to Jeff to go through the details of our Q4 results, I'd like to welcome Stewart Glendinning to our team. We recently announced that Stewart will take over as CFO at the end of March. Stewart joined the company earlier this year as our Chief Transformation Officer, where he has been heavily immersed in the Family Dollar sale process and charting the future course for Dollar Tree as a standalone organization. After Jeff's Q4 recap, I've asked Stewart to share our 2025 outlook.\n",
    "Finally, I want to thank Jeff Davis for his partnership these past 2.5 years and for helping to ensure a smooth transition as Stewart assumes his new role. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n",
    "Jeffrey A. DavisDollar Tree, Inc. · Chief Financial Officer\n",
    "Thank you, Mike, and good morning. I also want to extend my congratulations to Stewart. Having had the opportunity to work with Stewart over the past few months, I want to echo Mike's comments regarding what has been a smooth transition.\n",
    "Let me start with an overview of the changes in our financial reporting this quarter. Last June, we initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for Family Dollar, which ultimately resulted in the transaction we announced today. That process officially ended in the fourth quarter with the company's decision to pursue a sale. And accordingly, Family Dollar was classified as discontinued operations.\n",
    "As such, our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results are reported on a continuing operations basis, which includes the results of the Dollar Tree segment and Corporate, support and Other. Family Dollar's results are reported as discontinued operations.\n",
    "In our earnings release this morning, we provided schedules of our 2024 quarterly and annual GAAP and non-GAAP results on a continuing, discontinued and consolidated basis. Unless otherwise stated, my comments today reference our adjusted results from continuing operations.\n",
    "Also for comparability purposes, please keep in mind that Q4 and FY 2023 included a 53rd week, which positively impacted revenue by approximately $560 million and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.35.\n",
    "Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.11 from continuing operations and $0.18 from discontinued operations for a total adjusted enterprise EPS of $2.29, which compares to our outlook range of $2.10 to $2.30.\n",
    "Enterprise results include a $19 million or $0.07 per share benefit from a Mastercard settlement in discontinued ops and a $25 million or $0.09 per share charge for an antidumping duty recorded in continuing operations. Neither of these items were contemplated in our fourth quarter outlook. After netting both items, enterprise adjusted EPS would have been $0.01 above the high end of our outlook range.\n",
    "Turning to results from continuing operations. Adjusted operating income was $628 million, a 15% decrease from last year. Adjusted operating margin declined 230 basis points as gross margin declined 130 basis points and adjusted SG&A rate increased 100 basis points.\n",
    "Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.8% compared to 23.8%, reflecting higher nondeductible expenses for executive compensation and lower work opportunity tax credits in the current year.\n",
    "Adjusted net income was $455 million compared to $544 million. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.11, which includes the $0.09 impact from the antidumping duty.\n",
    "Now let me move to our fourth quarter results for the Dollar Tree segment. Adjusted operating income declined 12.1% to $768 million. Adjusted operating margin declined by approximately 220 basis points, reflecting a 130 basis point decline in gross margin and a 90 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate.\n",
    "Gross margin declined primarily from the loss of sales leverage, lower mark-on and higher shrink, distribution and markdown costs, partially offset by lower freight. Also note that Q4 cost of sales included the $25 million antidumping duty.\n",
    "Adjusted SG&A rate rose principally from higher depreciation and utilities expense and the loss of sales leverage, which was partially offset by lower general liability claims adjustments.\n",
    "Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. On a continuing operations basis, total inventory increased $176 million to $2.7 billion on higher mark-on and inventory receipts as we expanded our multi-price assortment. We ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n",
    "On the cash flow statement for continuing operations, on a full year basis, we generated $2.2 billion in cash from operating activities, had capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and delivered $893 million of free cash flow.\n",
    "We ended the year with no borrowings under our revolver, no commercial paper outstanding and bank-defined leverage below 2.5x. Last week, we extended the maturity of our $1.5 billion long-term revolving credit facility to 2030 from 2026. Additionally, we closed on a new $1 billion 364-day revolver ahead of the May maturity of our $1 billion 4% senior notes.\n",
    "We believe we have ample funding capacity between cash on hand and availability under these credit facilities to meet our near-term debt obligations and provide for the ongoing capital needs of the business.\n",
    "We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $404 million, including excise tax. At the end of the year, we had approximately $952 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program.\n",
    "And now let me turn the call over to Stewart.\n",
    "Stewart Glendinning\n",
    "Thank you, Jeff.\n",
    "Now let me provide our current perspective on fiscal 2025. With the pending sale of Family Dollar, 2025 will be a transitional year for Dollar Tree as a standalone business. We will be working to separate Family Dollar while simultaneously focusing on driving growth and operating improvements in Dollar Tree.\n",
    "Prior to the closing of the sale, continuing operations, or what we are calling RemainCo, will be burdened with the full cost of corporate shared services. After the sale closes, which we expect will be in June 2025, a transition services agreement, or TSA, will go into effect. This agreement will help offset the shared cost burden until such time as these costs are fully transitioned to the new owners, a process which should unfold throughout 2025 and into 2026.\n",
    "Looking forward to fiscal year 2025, we expect strong top line growth from the Dollar Tree banner, with sales being positively impacted by multi-price expansion, operating improvements in our stores, new store growth and the continuing ramp-up of our recently opened stores, especially the former 99 Cents Only portfolio.\n",
    "Taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal year 2025 sales will be in the range of $18.5 billion to $19.1 billion based on comparable store sales growth of 3% to 5%. We expect a modest improvement in gross margin based on the mitigation actions we've taken to date on implemented tariffs.\n",
    "That said, the tariff situation remains volatile, and any additional tariffs or unforeseen waterfall effects from the already announced tariffs could affect this assumption. Keep in mind Mike's comments about our ability to mitigate those tariffs over time.\n",
    "Outside of tariffs, we're forecasting favorability in mark-on, markdown and freight, with a partial offset from higher distribution costs related to incremental D&A from our supply chain investments and additional stem mile and other costs from losing the Marietta DC. Our freight cost outlook is positive across ocean and both inbound and outbound ground.\n",
    "For SG&A, I'll talk about Dollar Tree segment separately from Corporate, support and Other. Dollar Tree's adjusted SG&A rate in 2024 was 23.8%. In 2025, we expect deleverage of approximately 50 to 80 basis points. This is coming from higher store payroll related to our investments in additional hours and state-mandated minimum wage increases, management incentive compensation, D&A related to our elevated 2024 and 2025 CapEx investments as well as repair and maintenance, as we continue to improve store standards.\n",
    "Our corporate adjusted SG&A in 2024 was approximately $550 million. We expect this to grow by approximately 20% in 2025. The largest contributor to the year-over-year increase is IT spending, as we move systems off legacy platforms and onto the cloud, followed by payroll from merit increases and incentive comp and D&A.\n",
    "Under the TSA that I mentioned earlier, we expect to receive approximately $95 million in the last 6 months of 2025 for services provided to Family Dollar over the second half of the year and a similar amount next year. While we will receive TSA income in connection with the cost of supporting Family Dollar for the second half of the year, we will incur these costs over the entire year. This negatively impacts our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.30 to $0.35, given the expected timing of the deal closing.\n",
    "On a normalized basis, had we received TSA payments for the full year, our net corporate costs at RemainCo would be lower, and our adjusted EPS would be $0.30 to $0.35 higher than the outlook we are providing.\n",
    "Over the next several years, we expect absolute Corporate SG&A dollars will go down, as overhead costs permanently shift to Family Dollar's new owners. Our Corporate infrastructure adjusts to the level needed to properly support a single banner, stranded costs go away and the TSA runs its course. We are targeting a reduction in our adjusted Corporate SG&A rate of approximately 100 basis points over the medium term.\n",
    "Finishing out the P&L, we expect net interest and other income of approximately $115 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 25.2% and 216 million shares outstanding, which does not reflect any share repurchases.\n",
    "Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $5 to $5.50, which compares to last year's $5.10. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, including approximately 400 new Dollar Tree store openings.\n",
    "With respect to cash, we started the year with $1.3 billion on the balance sheet and expect to receive approximately $800 million of net proceeds from the Family Dollar sale. On top of this, we expect tax benefits from losses on the sale to be approximately $350 million accretive on a cash flow basis.\n",
    "Our capital allocation priorities remain investing and growing the business, then returning excess cash to shareholders with our preferred vehicle to date having been share repurchase. It is reasonable to assume that we will be back in the market repurchasing shares this year.\n",
    "Our balance sheet is strong. For this reason, we expect to come to market with a new debt offering following our May debt maturity and the closing of the Family Dollar sale.\n",
    "In the near term, we expect first quarter net sales to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion based on comparable net sales growth in the 3% to 5% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.25.\n",
    "In summary, 2025 is going to be a transitional year. With the sale of Family Dollar, we can fully focus on unlocking value at Dollar Tree. We had a solid 2024, and we feel good about many parts of our business heading into 2025.\n",
    "We're optimistic about the top line, and we're addressing cost pressures on several fronts, with tariffs being at the top of that list. We feel great about our cash position and our ability to generate meaningful levels of cash going forward.\n",
    "With a solid balance sheet and prudent CapEx commitments, we should have the ability to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders this year and into the future.\n",
    "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.\n",
    "Michael C. CreedonDollar Tree, Inc. · CEO & Director\n",
    "Thanks, Stewart. This is a pivotal time at Dollar Tree. We are shifting our long-term operational focus away from an integrated 2-banner model. With the sale of Family Dollar, our leadership team can focus all our energy and resources on growing Dollar Tree.\n",
    "I strongly believe selling Family Dollar and returning to our roots with an expanded assortment at Dollar Tree has created material value. Dollar Tree remains one of the best growth stories in retail, and the separation of the 2 businesses will allow us to move forward with a single-minded focus of driving growth and profitability.\n",
    "As Stewart indicated, 2025 is going to be a transition year as we pivot to operating Dollar Tree as a standalone entity. After 2025, on a go-forward basis, we will drive top line results by growing comp and opening new stores. We expect increased sales productivity will allow us to expand gross margin, begin leveraging SG&A and grow EPS. Most importantly, by returning a meaningful level of cash to our shareholders, we can leverage that EPS growth even more.\n",
    "I'd like to close with a shout-out to the entirety of the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar teams. They have worked masterfully and tirelessly on behalf of our shareholders and our customers. I could not be more honored to count myself among them.\n",
    "And with that, we're ready to take your questions.\n",
